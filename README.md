# First Hello World Application - KOTLIN
This small Hello World application created using Kotlin and Android Studio.



# HOW TO INSTALL ANDROID STUDIO

# Installing JDK (Java Development Kit)
1- Follow this link https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows to install JDK.

2- Download the latest verion of it, taking into account your computer's system specifications.

3- Run the android studio and follow the next steps (if your antivirus program is preventing the program from running, right-click and click on the "run as administration" option)

4- Please pay attention to the location where JDK has been installed! Let's assume this is the location -->   C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14\  

5- Find this location in your computer -->  C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14\  . You will see "bin" file. Click the bin and find "java.exe or java file". Right-click on the java.exe or java find the "properties" in order to find out the location of it. Copy the location because it will be used later.

6- Go to "thisPC/myPC" -> click the "Advanced system settings" -> a small window will be shown, click the "Environment Variables" button -> At the bottom of System variable there will be "Path",  hover over the "Path" and press the "Edit" button. Paste the address that you copied (java.exe or java's address)

7- Press OK button so as to save the changes.

8- Go to developer.android.com (https://developer.android.com/) -> Find the Android Studio -> Press the Android Studio tab -> After it is downloaded, open the file by double-clicking (if your antivirus program is preventing the program from running, right-click and click on the "run as administration" option). Without any change click the next buttons until the installation is completed. Click the "Finish" button, and there you go!



# Installation SDK (Software Development Kit)
Firstly, run Android Studio. Please follow these steps in order.

1- Choose the type of setup you want for Android Studio : Choose "custom" , press next.

2- You will see the default JDK location. Press the next.

3- Select one of UI theme. Press next.

4- In the SDK Components Setup page, select any possible option to be selected and click next (some of the options may not be selectable but it is no matter)




  # Emulator Settings
  Use recommended size for RAM and press next.
  
  Press the "finish"
  
  Wait until the installation is  completed. After that, click the "finish" again.
  
  Create your first project.
  
  At the top, there is a section called "AVD manager". Because you don't have any devices, no devives will be seen. So, press "Create Virtual Device" button.
  
  Be sure you choose device for Phone category, select "Pixel 2" (Attention: Any version is acceptable, it is optional)
  
  Select a system image : It is better to opt the latest version (R - Android 10.0) but it is still not compulsory. Download it and press the next button.
  
  Accept License Agreement.
  
  Wait for the installation, in case you face with a problem, go back and try to download any other version.
  
  Press next and finish.
  
  ATTENTION: In some cases "HAXM failed to load error" can occur or "Android Emulator" failed to be installed. In such cases you can follow this steps:
  In the "File" section go to "settings/prefernces". In the searching area, write SDK. Click SDK Tools and if Emulator or HAXM are not installed, click download button manually.That will help you a lot. 
 
That's it, you are ready to run your program.
